  models are trained with a linear head on top of a frozen backbone and are useful to
  evaluate the quality of pretrained DINOv2 models.
- Make fine-tune transform arguments configurable in the `train_semantic_segmentation`
  command. You can now use the `transform_args` argument like this
  ```python
  transform_args={

    "normalize": {"mean": (0.0, 0.0, 0.0), "std": (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)}, # (r, g, b) channels
  }
  ```
  to customize the image augmentations used during training and validation. See the
  [semantic segmentation documentation](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/semantic_segmentation.html#default-image-transform-arguments)
  for more information.
- Add support for the channel drop transform in the `train_semantic_segmentation`
  command.
- Add support for mapping multiple classes into a single class for semantic segmentation
  datasets. You can now use a dictionary in the `classes` entry of the `data` argument
  in the `train_semantic_segmentation` command like this:
  ```python
  data={
    "classes": {
      0: {"name": "background", "values": [0, 255]}, # Map classes 0 and 255 to class 0
      1: {"name": "class 1", "values": [1]},
      2: "class 2",  # Still supported. Equivalent to {"name": "class 2", "values": [2]}
    },
  }
  ```

  correct device.

  error.
- Fix MLFlow logging on AzureML.

## [0.11.0] - 2025-08-15

🚀 **New DINOv3 Support:** Pretrain your own model with
[distillation](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/pretrain_distill/methods/distillation.html#methods-distillation-dinov3)
from DINOv3 weights. Or fine-tune our SOTA
[EoMT semantic segmentation model](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/semantic_segmentation.html#semantic-segmentation-eomt-dinov3)
with a DINOv3 backbone! 🚀

fine-tuning method! 🔥

### Added

### Changed

- DINOv2 model names to be more consistent with the new naming scheme. The model name
  scheme changed from `dinov2_vit/vits14_pretrain` to `dinov2/vits14`. The pretrained
  weights are now always loaded by default, making the `pretrain` suffix redundant.
- DINOv2 models are now using registers by default which increases model performance.
  You can continue using models without registers with the `-noreg` suffix:
  `dinov2/vits14-noreg`.
- DINOv2 and distillation to work with image resolutions that are not a multiple of the
  patch size.

  `resume_interrupted` and will be removed in a future release. The new parameter
  behaves the same as the old one but is more explicit about its purpose. See
  [the documentation](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/pretrain_distill/index.html#resume-training)
