## Benchmark Results

Below we provide the models and report the validation mAP and inference latency of
different DINOv3 models fine-tuned on COCO with LightlyTrain. You can check
[here](instance-segmentation-train) how to use these models for further fine-tuning.

You can also explore running inference and training these models using our Colab
notebook:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lightly-ai/lightly-train/blob/main/examples/notebooks/eomt_instance_segmentation.ipynb)

### COCO

| Implementation | Model                            | Val mAP mask | Avg. Latency (ms) | Params (M) | Input Size |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| LightlyTrain   | dinov3/vitt16-eomt-inst-coco     | 25.4         | 12.7              | 6.0        | 640×640    |
| LightlyTrain   | dinov3/vitt16plus-eomt-inst-coco | 27.6         | 13.3              | 7.7        | 640×640    |
| LightlyTrain   | dinov3/vits16-eomt-inst-coco     | 32.6         | 19.4              | 21.6       | 640×640    |
| LightlyTrain   | dinov3/vitb16-eomt-inst-coco     | 40.3         | 39.7              | 85.7       | 640×640    |
| LightlyTrain   | dinov3/vitl16-eomt-inst-coco     | **46.2**     | 80.0              | 303.2      | 640×640    |
| Original EoMT  | dinov3/vitl16-eomt-inst-coco     | 45.9         | -                 | 303.2      | 640×640    |

Training follows the protocol in the original
[EoMT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19108). All models are trained on the COCO
dataset with batch size `16` and learning rate `2e-4`. Models using `vitt16` or
`vitt16plus` train for 540K steps (~72 epochs). The remaining ones are trained for 90K
steps (~12 epochs). The average latency values were measured with model compilation
using `torch.compile` on a single NVIDIA T4 GPU with FP16 precision.

## Train an Instance Segmentation Model

Training an instance segmentation model with LightlyTrain is straightforward and only
requires a few lines of code. See [data](#instance-segmentation-data) for more details
on how to prepare your dataset.

```python
import lightly_train

if __name__ == "__main__":
    lightly_train.train_instance_segmentation(
        out="out/my_experiment",
        model="dinov3/vitl16-eomt-inst-coco", 
        data={
            "path": "my_data_dir",      # Path to dataset directory
            "train": "images/train",    # Path to training images
            "val": "images/val",        # Path to validation images
            "names": {                  # Classes in the dataset                    
                0: "background",
                1: "car",
                2: "bicycle",
                # ...
            },
            # Optional, classes that are in the dataset but should be ignored during
            # training.
            # "ignore_classes": [0],
            #
            # Optional, skip images without label files. By default, these are included
            # as negative samples.
            # "skip_if_label_file_missing": True,
        },
    )
```

During training, the best and last model weights are exported to
`out/my_experiment/exported_models/`, unless disabled in `save_checkpoint_args`:

- best (highest validation mask mAP): `exported_best.pt`
- last: `exported_last.pt`

You can use these weights to continue fine-tuning on another dataset by loading the
weights with `model="<checkpoint path>"`:

```python
import lightly_train

if __name__ == "__main__":
    lightly_train.train_instance_segmentation(
        out="out/my_experiment",
        model="out/my_experiment/exported_models/exported_best.pt",  # Continue training from the best model
        data={...},
    )
```

(instance-segmentation-inference)=

### Load the Trained Model from Checkpoint and Predict

After the training completes, you can load the best model checkpoints for inference like
this:

```python
import lightly_train

model = lightly_train.load_model("out/my_experiment/exported_models/exported_best.pt")
results = model.predict("image.jpg")
results["labels"]   # Class labels, tensor of shape (num_instances,)
results["masks"]    # Binary masks, tensor of shape (num_instances, height, width).
                    # Height and width correspond to the original image size.
results["scores"]   # Confidence scores, tensor of shape (num_instances,)
```

Or use one of the pretrained models directly from LightlyTrain:

```python
import lightly_train

model = lightly_train.load_model("dinov3/vitl16-eomt-inst-coco")
results = model.predict("image.jpg")
```

### Visualize the Predictions

You can visualize the predicted masks like this:

```python skip_ruff
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from torchvision.io import read_image
from torchvision.utils import draw_segmentation_masks

image = read_image("image.jpg")
image_with_masks = draw_segmentation_masks(image, results["masks"], alpha=0.6)
plt.imshow(image_with_masks.permute(1, 2, 0))
```

<!--

# Figure created with

import lightly_train
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from torchvision.io import decode_image
from torchvision.utils import draw_segmentation_masks
import urllib.request

model = lightly_train.load_model("251107_dinov3_vitb16_eomt_inst_coco.pt")
img = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"
results = model.predict(img)
masks = results["masks"]
scores = results["scores"]

urllib.request.urlretrieve(img, "/tmp/image.jpg")
image = decode_image("/tmp/image.jpg")
image_with_masks = draw_segmentation_masks(image, masks, alpha=1.0)

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 6))
ax1.imshow(image.permute(1, 2, 0))
ax2.imshow(image_with_masks.permute(1, 2, 0))
ax1.axis("off")
ax2.axis("off")
fig.savefig("out/preds/inst_seg.jpg", bbox_inches="tight")
fig.show()
-->

```

(instance-segmentation-data)=

## Data

Lightly**Train** supports instance segmentation datasets in YOLO format. Every image
must have a corresponding annotation file that contains for every object in the image a
line with the class ID and (x1, y1, x2, y2, ...) polygon coordinates in normalized
format.

```text
0 0.782016 0.986521 0.937078 0.874167 0.957297 0.782021 0.950562 0.739333
1 0.557859 0.143813 0.487078 0.0314583 0.859547 0.00897917 0.985953 0.130333 0.984266 0.184271
```

The following image formats are supported:

- jpg
- jpeg
- png
- ppm
- bmp
- pgm
- tif
- tiff
- webp

Your dataset directory must be organized like this:

```text
my_data_dir/
├── images
│   ├── train
│   │   ├── image1.jpg
│   │   ├── image2.jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   └── val
│       ├── image1.jpg
│       ├── image2.jpg
│       └── ...
└── labels
    ├── train
    │   ├── image1.txt
    │   ├── image2.txt
    │   └── ...
    └── val
        ├── image1.txt
        ├── image2.txt
        └── ...
```

Alternatively, the train/val splits can also be at the top level:

```text
my_data_dir/
├── train
│   ├── images
│   │   ├── image1.jpg
│   │   ├── image2.jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   └── labels
│       ├── image1.txt
│       ├── image2.txt
│       └── ...
└── val
    ├── images
    │   ├── image1.jpg
    │   ├── image2.jpg
    │   └── ...
    └── labels
        ├── image1.txt
        ├── image2.txt
        └── ...
```

The `data` argument in `train_instance_segmentation` must point to the dataset directory
and specify the paths to the training and validation images relative to the dataset
directory. For example:

```python
import lightly_train

if __name__ == "__main__":
    lightly_train.train_instance_segmentation(
        out="out/my_experiment",
        model="dinov3/vitl16-eomt-inst-coco", 
        data={
            "path": "my_data_dir",      # Path to dataset directory
            "train": "images/train",    # Path to training images
            "val": "images/val",        # Path to validation images
            "names": {                  # Classes in the dataset                    
                0: "background",        # Classes must match those in the annotation files
                1: "car",
                2: "bicycle",
                # ...
            },
        },
    )
```

### Missing Labels

There are three cases in which an image may not have any corresponding labels:

1. The label file is missing.
1. The label file is empty.
1. The label file only contains annotations for classes that are in `ignore_classes`.

LightlyTrain treats all three cases as "negative" samples and includes the images in
training with an empty list of segmentation masks.

If you would like to exclude images without label files from training, you can set the
`skip_if_label_file_missing` argument in the `data` configuration. This only excludes
images without a label file (case 1) but still includes cases 2 and 3 as negative
samples.

```python
import lightly_train

if __name__ == "__main__":
    lightly_train.train_instance_segmentation(
        ...,
        data={
            "path": "my_data_dir",
            "train": "images/train",
            "val": "images/val",
            "names": {...},
            "skip_if_label_file_missing": True, # Skip images without label files.
        }
    )
```

(instance-segmentation-onnx)=

## Exporting a Checkpoint to ONNX

[Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Neural_Network_Exchange)
is a standard format for representing machine learning models in a framework independent
manner. In particular, it is useful for deploying our models on edge devices where
PyTorch is not available.

### Requirements

Exporting to ONNX requires some additional packages to be installed. Namely

- [onnx](https://pypi.org/project/onnx/)
- [onnxruntime](https://pypi.org/project/onnxruntime/) if `verify` is set to `True`.
- [onnxslim](https://pypi.org/project/onnxslim/) if `simplify` is set to `True`.

You can install them with:

```bash
pip install "lightly-train[onnx,onnxruntime,onnxslim]"
```

The following example shows how to export a previously trained model to ONNX.

```python
import lightly_train

# Instantiate the model from a checkpoint.
model = lightly_train.load_model("out/my_experiment/exported_models/exported_best.pt")

# Export the PyTorch model to ONNX.
model.export_onnx(
    out="out/my_experiment/exported_models/model.onnx",
    # precision="fp16", # Export model with FP16 weights for smaller size and faster inference.
)
```

See {py:meth}`~.DINOv3EoMTInstanceSegmentation.export_onnx` for all available options
when exporting to ONNX.

The following notebook shows how to export a model to ONNX in Colab:
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lightly-ai/lightly-train/blob/main/examples/notebooks/instance_segmentation_export.ipynb)

(instance-segmentation-tensorrt)=

## Exporting a Checkpoint to TensorRT

TensorRT engines are built from an ONNX representation of the model. The
`export_tensorrt` method internally exports the model to ONNX (see the ONNX export
section above) before building a [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt)
engine for fast GPU inference.

### Requirements

TensorRT is not part of LightlyTrain’s dependencies and must be installed separately.
Installation depends on your OS, Python version, GPU, and NVIDIA driver/CUDA setup. See
the
[TensorRT documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/latest/installing-tensorrt/installing.html)
for more details.

On CUDA 12.x systems you can often install the Python package via:

```bash
pip install tensorrt-cu12
```

```python
import lightly_train

# Instantiate the model from a checkpoint.
model = lightly_train.load_model("out/my_experiment/exported_models/exported_best.pt")

# Export to TensorRT from an ONNX file.
model.export_tensorrt(
    out="out/my_experiment/exported_models/model.trt", # TensorRT engine destination.
    # precision="fp16", # Export model with FP16 weights for smaller size and faster inference.
)
```

See {py:meth}`~.DINOv3EoMTInstanceSegmentation.export_tensorrt` for all available
options when exporting to TensorRT.

You can also learn more about exporting EoMT to TensorRT using our Colab notebook:
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lightly-ai/lightly-train/blob/main/examples/notebooks/instance_segmentation_export.ipynb)
